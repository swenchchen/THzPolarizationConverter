1. System requirements

All codes (.m files) are run with MATLAB software (version 2019 used in this work), which supports Windows operating system (Windows 11 used in this work);

2. Installation guide

Guide on installing MATLAB can be found from the MATLAB official document

3. Demo

Apart from the codes in the folder "Basic_Processing_Code", all the other codes can be run directly to get the corresponding experimental results and figures. The folder "Basic_Processing_Code" should be included in the reading path of MATLAB since the codes in this folder will be called in other processing codes. Most of the codes can be run with a few seconds on a "normal" desktop computer.

4. Instructions for use

Simply click run on each code to process the data and generate the figures.

Apart from the folder "Basic_Processing_Code", all the other folders correspond to different section & data of the paper, which can be referred to the folder name. Codes with names of "process" are to process the raw experimental data and may saved the processed data into new .mat files for figure plot. Codes with names of "plot" are to plot figures in the manuscript or supplementary information. The Folder "Theroy_and_Prediction" contains the theoretical model calculation with NO experimental data. In this folder, "theory.m" is to calculate the theoretical phase control (Fig. 1d in the manuscript). "plarization_prediction.m" is the algorithm to calculate the required mirror height and LC birefringence (time delay) for a target polarization centered at a target frequency. "bandwidth_test.m" calculates the structure performance over the entire 0.6-10THz bandwidth.
